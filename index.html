  <h2>Web Security</h2>
  <p id="web security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks?</p>
  <p id="web security-answer">Here are my recommendations on how to secure and protect your website: <br>
     It is important to update your site as soon as a new plugin or CMS version is available. <br>
     You should use a website firewall, which will virtually patch the security hole as soon as updates are released. <br>
    You should have strong passwords. The best practices for you to have a strong password are: do not reuse your passwords, have long passwords, use random passwords <br>
    It is ideal that hosting a website on a single server. <br>
    You should do limit user access & permissions. <br> 
    You can avoid a large number of attacks simply by changing the default settings when installing your CMS of choice. <br>
    You should select secure extensions and these are the things to look for when deciding which extensions to use: check when the extension was last updated, pat attention to the age of the extension and the number of installs, use legitimate and trusted sources. <br>
    In the event of a hack, website backups are crucial to recovering your website from a major security incident. <br>
    Get to know your web server configuration files: Apache web servers use the .htaccess file, Nginx servers use nginx.conf, Microsoft IIS servers use web.config. <br>
    Here are a few best practices to add for a particular web server: prevent directory browsing, prevent image hotlinking, protect sensitive files. <br>
    You should install an SSL Certificate. <br>
    You should install scanning and monitoring tools. <br>
    You should follow personal security best practices. </p>
