- NOTE: When The product list page should display a list of all products fetched from the API,the catch(error) method is working while there is a change or missing part of this URL for the API is https://api.noroff.dev.
  But the catch(error) method does not work when there is a change or missing in the /api/v1/square-eyes extension. Because when this extension is missing or different, Json returns an object that is errors.
  Therefore, since there is no error condition, it is as if we are still getting information from json. I couldn't activate the catch(error) method no matter what I did.
